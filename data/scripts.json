Kufi developed around the end of the 7th century in Kufa, Iraq, from which it takes its name, and other centres. Until about the 11th century it was the main script used to copy Qur'ans. Square or geometric Kufi is a very simplified rectangular style of Kufi widely used for tiling.",

The straight angular forms of Kufi script were replaced in the new script by curved and oblique lines. In Thuluth, one-third of each letter slopes, from which the name (meaning \"a third\" in Arabic) comes. It is a large and elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. Various calligraphic styles evolved from Thuluth through slight changes of form.",

The root of this Arabic term nasakh-a means \"to copy\". It either refers to the fact that it replaced its predecessor, Kufi script, or that this style allows faster copying of texts. With small modifications, it is the style most commonly used for printing Arabic, Persian, Pashto and Sindhi languages. This type of script was derived from Thuluth by introducing a number of modifications resulting in smaller size and greater delicacy. It is written using a small, very fine pen known as a cava pen, which makes the script eminently suitable for use in book production. It was and is a very widely used form of script. Computers typically use Naskh or a Naskh-like script.",

It was labeled the Diwani script because it was used in the Ottoman diwan (chief revenue officer of a province) and was one of the secrets of the sultan's palace. The rules of this script were not known to everyone, but confined to its masters and a few bright students. It was used in the writing of all royal decrees, endowments, and resolutions.  Diwani is marked by beauty and harmony, and accurate small samples are considered more beautiful than larger ones. It is still used in the correspondence of kings, princes, presidents, and in ceremonies and greeting cards. and has a high artistic value.",

It is amongst the most fluid calligraphy styles for the Arabic alphabet. It has short verticals with no serifs, and long horizontal strokes. ",
